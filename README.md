# CalendarChallenge

# Functionality
This app is developed without using CSS Grid to properly demonstrate logic using javascript concepts.
The start and end are minutes since 9am, so 30 is 9:30 am, 120 is 11am, etc. 
const events = [{start: 30, end: 120}, {start: 300, end: 330}, {start: 290, end: 330}]
